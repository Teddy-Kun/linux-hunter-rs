WIP Rust rewrite of [linux-hunter](https://github.com/Emanem/linux-hunter).

## Why a Rust rewrite

We are living the meme ladies and mentlegen...

Jokes aside though my reasoning is very simple. I have never written anything similar to this and it seemed like a fun thing to do, to learn a few new tricks. Also I am not the biggest fan of C++ and Emanem seems to have no plans of maintining the original anymore, so depending on how this goes, I would like to not be stuck in a language that I somewhat dislike.
